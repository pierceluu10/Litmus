## What Litmus is
Litmus turns the claims a human highlighted in research papers (in their **Papiers** library) into real
experiments, runs them with parallel AI agents on **Modal** A100s, grades them with a locked stats
module, and lets the human steer at every branch point. The research is a constellation: each **star**
is a training configuration that was actually run (5+ seeds) and graded; each **line** is one change,
traced to a highlight, note, or human decision. Findings go back to Papiers.

Testbed: Keller Jordan's airbench (≈94% CIFAR-10 in seconds). Built for the Papiers Human-Centred
Autoresearch Challenge, Hack the Valley 11.

## Architecture
```
Papiers CLI ──read──▶ papiers_client ──▶ library context (judgment-weighted claims)
                                              │
FastAPI (REST + WS) ◀──events── LangGraph engine (SQLite checkpoints, thread = session)
   ▲    │                           │  intake → baseline → propose → [interrupt: human selects]
   │    └── human actions ──────────┘    → fan-out → branch ×N: plan → run → grade → reflect
   │        dispatch/answer/feedback        (reflect: library search, question, follow-ups)
   │                                     → join → budget → loop | abstract → write-back
Frontend (React)                 Modal app "litmus": train(knobs, seed) on A100, streams epochs
Grader (pure stats) ◀── seeds ── results (cached by config hash in SQLite)
```

## Repo map
| Path | Owner | What |
|---|---|---|
| `shared/contract.md` | shared | API + event contract. Source of truth. Additive changes only, on `main`. |
| `shared/demo-session.json` | backend | Recorded real session for replay + frontend mock mode. |
| `backend/` | backend agent | Python 3.11 package `litmus` (uv). Frontend agent never edits here. |
| `frontend/` | frontend agent | React + TS + Vite. Backend agent never edits here. |

## Running the backend
```bash
cd backend
uv sync
cp ../.env.example .env   # fill OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL
uv run litmus --help
```

## Env vars (`backend/.env`, gitignored)
| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` | LLM calls (structured outputs) |
| `PAPIERS_TOKEN` | Papiers CLI auth (optional if `papiers auth login` was run) |
| `LITMUS_BUDGET_GPU_SECONDS` | default per-session GPU budget |

## Setup facts
- Use `uv` (installed via Homebrew). System Python is 3.9: do not use it.
- `modal` is not on PATH globally: use `uv run modal ...` inside `backend/`. Auth is `~/.modal.toml`.
- Modal workspace `pierceluu10`, Starter plan, 10 concurrent GPUs max.
- Volume `cifar-data` holds `/cifar-10-python.tar.gz` (md5 `c58f30108f718f92721af3b95e74349a`).
  **Never download CIFAR inside Modal** (≈40 KB/s). Mount the volume.
- Papiers CLI `papiers` (npm, v0.1.5) is **read-only**: search, list, read, browse, auth, tokens,
  doctor. There is no write command, so findings are exported as Markdown for manual import.

## Conventions
- Branches: `main` ← `backend` (integration) ← `feat/<feature>`. Feature branches merge into `backend`
  with `--no-ff`. `backend` merges into `main` only when the human says so.
- Contract changes: small `docs(contract): ...` commit on `main`, push, Changelog line.
- Conventional Commits: `feat(modal): ...`, `fix(grader): ...`, `test(papiers): ...`, `docs(agents): ...`.
- Never commit secrets. `.env` is gitignored.
